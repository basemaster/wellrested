Additional Components
=====================

The core WellRESTed library is designed to be very small and limited in scope. It should do only what's needed, and no more. One of WellRESTed's main goals is to stay small, and not force anything on consumers.

That being said, there are a number or situations that come up that warrant solutions. For that, WellRESTed also provides a (growing) number of companion packages that you may find useful, depending on the project.

`HTTP Exceptions`_
    A collection of Exception classes that correspond to common HTTP error status codes.

`Error Handling`_
    Classes to facilitate error handling including

`Test Components`_
    Test cases and doubles for use with WellRESTed
